Physics degrees awarded by US institutions from 2015-2023 disaggregated by ethnicity and gender.

The data above was collected from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Database.

I have tabulated first and second degrees for every degree-granting institution reporting to the US Department of Education, disaggregated by both gender and ethnicity as the DOE defines it in their database.

Physics departments are continually under threat:

·         https://www.aps.org/apsnews/2024/08/universities-shuttering-departments

·         https://www.aps.org/archives/publications/apsnews/201110/physicsprograms.cfm

One thing the EP3 Toolkit for Departments Under Threat suggests is to gather high-quality data, and present it to normalize departmental achievement with near-peer organizations, be they regional or through Carnegie classification. 

 
It is my hope that these data will help departments under threat in an important way. These are just data, however, but they are data on completions of degrees. I can hardly imagine a stronger metric for student success than helping a student earn a degree in physics, with all the life-changing and family-changing effects that entails.

These data have been vetting in a couple of ways by me, but this data set is the result of my work as a single overworked physicist whose main responsibility is a full-load of classes. 

Please send errors or suggestions to Galen.Pickett@csulb.edu.
